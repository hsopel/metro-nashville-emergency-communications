# Metro Nashville Emergency Communications

During the tornado on March 3rd, 2020 and the derecho on May 3rd, 2020, Nashville Emergency Communications received a number of 911 calls and dispatches were issued to address them. We have been given data for the calls and dispatches around these times and will analyze the data to gain insights. Some possible directions for your analysis are:
- A timeline of each storm
- Beginning and end of the event
- Times of stronger storm impacts, based on call volumes
- The geographic path of the storm generating reports of damage or impact
- Locations of heaviest storm impact based on call volume
- Locations less impacted or not impacted, based on call volume (or lack thereof)
- The types of structures impacted (Residential? Commercial?)
- Communities within the County most impacted by the storms?
- A comparison of the storm paths with areas of the community impacted by Covid today (map available at https://nashville.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=30dd8aa876164e05ad6c0a1726fc77a4)
- A correlation identifying the demographic and economic realities of each community impacted by the storm and to what severity

### Approach:
Start by **Exploring the data** to identify possible areas of interest as well as any issues in the data you will have to address before continuing your analysis. Note down any trends, visualizations, outlier data points, etc. that you find interesting.

We will then reconvene as a class and decide on the direction that each group will pursue for their main analysis.

### Team Contribution
My team focused our analysis on the number of reported police incidents in Nashville the seven days prior to and following each storm. We looked at the number of incidents in the zip codes directly affected by each storm and compared that to the numbers in the zip codes that weren't directly affected. We did not see an increase in incidents after either storm so we were able to inform the director of emergency communications that based on these two events he shouldn't necessarily expect to see an increase in 911 calls related to crime following a future natural disaster. The full class presentation can be found in the repository.
